    '''
    The class sudokuAlgFactory implements the Factory Method pattern to deal
    with the instantiation of a concrete algorithm without exposing the
    instantiation logic to the main program, thus reducing the coupling
    
    Methods
    -------
    create: static method
        It returns an object that contains the selected algorithm for solving
        a sudoku.
